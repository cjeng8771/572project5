Resources for Project 5 for ESE 572 \

1. Determine a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for broadcasting. Specify the algorithm
you are using and show each iteration as part of determining the final MST pattern. \
\
2. Determine the shortest path between the following pairs of nodes: (A, J), (B,I), (A,G),
(E,F), (B,J), and (D,G). Specify which algorithm you are using and show each
iteration as part of determining the final routing patterns \
